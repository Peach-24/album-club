# An online album club app for friends

**Brief**

I'm creating a social review platform for groups of friends to nominate albums to collectively listen to, and then submit feedback on.

It is a rudimentary looking front-end but fully functional and in use by my friends and I. We used to co-ordinate an album-listening club through messaging apps, where we would suggest less-listened-to albums and write our own reviews and score the albums suggested by eachother. We now have a dedicated, responsive, and hosted web app to do this.

- As it stands, this is a private app for a group of friends. Therefore there is one password to get into the app, and limited person choices when suggesting and reviewing albums. I plan to make this more scalable by allowing users to have their own accounts, with a password for their own "Album Club".

### Next steps

- Implement Firebase/Auth for separate user accounts
- More detailed options for suggesting multiple albums, allowing other users in the group to vote for which they want to listen to.
- Spotify API integration.

### Technologies

- React
- Firebase, Auth & Firestore
- React Router
- Cypress

### NOTE

- I'm using a proxy server to allow me to fetch album artwork through an api - used when the user suggests an album.

### Want to take a closer look?

Are you an employer looking for a creative and ambitious junior developer? I would love for you to take a closer look at this project, but I ask that if you do want to suggest an album, or write a review, you choose the user 'Peach' to do it. Thank you.
