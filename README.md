# An online album club app for friends

### Brief

In 2020, my friends and I came up with the idea of taking turns nominating a lesser-listened-to album for us to listen to and then share a written review and score. It kept us in touch over various lockdowns and helped vary our usual musical digest. Because we were doing it via a messaging app, there were logistical issues that hampered the overall experience of our 'Album Club' idea. It wasn't easy to quickly find out what the current album was, nor could we view reviews submitted by others without having to scroll through endless messages in the chat.

Those issues are a thing of the past now that I've built a dedicated responsive web app. Through building version one, in not much longer than a week, I've learnt how to use Cypress testing, sharpened my React skills, and made use of a firebase database to keep track of suggested albums and reviews.

- As it stands, this is a private app for a group of friends. Therefore there is one password to get into the app, and limited person choices when suggesting and reviewing albums. I plan to make this more scalable by allowing users to have their own accounts, with a password for their own "Album Club".

### Next steps

- Implement Firebase/Auth for separate user accounts
- More detailed options for suggesting multiple albums, allowing other users in the group to vote for which they want to listen to
- Spotify API integration

### Technologies

- React
- Firebase, Auth & Firestore
- React Router
- Cypress

### NOTE

- I'm using a proxy server to allow me to fetch album artwork through an api - used when the user suggests an album.

### Want to take a closer look?

Are you an employer looking for a creative and ambitious junior developer? I would love for you to take a closer look at this project, but I ask that if you do want to suggest an album, or write a review, you choose the user 'Peach' to do it. Thank you.
- Please get in touch if you want to find out the password.
